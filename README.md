# Regex to DFA Converter

## Overview

This program is a Regex to DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) Converter. It takes a regular expression as input and generates a DFA that accepts any string matched by the regular expression. The DFA provides a more efficient way to match strings against the given regular expression, especially for complex patterns.

## Features

- Converts a regular expression to a DFA.
- Accepts any string that matches the given regular expression.
- Supports basic regular expression syntax including:
  - Concatenation (`ab`)
  - Alternation (`a|b`)
  - Kleene star (`a*`)
  - Parentheses for grouping `(a|b)*`
- Provides a visual representation of the DFA for better understanding.
