Regex to DFA Converter
Overview
This program is a Regex to DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) Converter. It takes a regular expression as input and generates a DFA that accepts any string matched by the regular expression. The DFA provides a more efficient way to match strings against the given regular expression, especially for complex patterns.

Features
Converts a regular expression to a DFA.
Accepts any string that matches the given regular expression.
Supports basic regular expression syntax including:
Concatenation (ab)
Alternation (a|b)
Kleene star (a*)
Parentheses for grouping (a|b)*
Provides a visual representation of the DFA for better understanding.
